# `zone save --name`, end to end: the value typed is the value the
# child process gets, through the provider, the cache and `zone load`,
# and nothing in between reads it as anything but text.
#
#   bash test/save.sh
#
# Every shape a person will type or paste is here, and each is checked
# BYTE FOR BYTE (JSON-encoded on the way out, so a lost newline or a
# stripped quote is visible): an integer, a float, both booleans, a zero,
# a line with spaces, quotes, angle brackets, a dollar and a hash, a url,
# a pasted value with CRLF endings and surrounding whitespace, and a
# multi-line PEM key on stdin.
#
# Also held here:
#
#   the save is report-only without --commit, and asks for nothing
#   the cache follows the write, so no `zone read --fresh` is needed
#   a second save of the same name updates, never duplicates
#   a name declared under a nested zone is filed under that zone
#   a name with a `from` is stored under the from key, the one read fetches
#   a `bind` edit in zone.tree reaches the next load with no provider call
#   a comment edit does not make `zone test` refuse the cache
#   no value is ever printed
#
# Headless. The fake SDK persists its writes to $ZONE_FAKE_STORE so a save
# and a load, two processes, see one provider. No keychain, no network.
