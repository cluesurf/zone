// Cache round trip and the warm-read budget, run against the compiled output.

// Seals a set of values, writes a `zone.code.tree`, reads it back, and opens
// every value through the inherited lookup. Then measures the warm path,
// which is what `zone load` pays on every single invocation.
//
// THE BUDGET IS 50 MILLISECONDS and it is the reason the cache exists.
// `bws --version`, which does no network work at all, takes 930ms on the
// machine this was written on. A tool that costs a second per command gets
// worked around within a week.

// The globals `term boot` prepends, installed by hand. FIRST, before any
// import of ../host/**. See test/shim.ts.
