// The secret note: written as `host` data, read by the compiler.
//
//   pnpm exec tsx test/note.ts        (from the zone package)
//
// THE POINT OF THIS SUITE is that the note is parsed by the Term
// compiler through the mill, not by a line reader. So the cases that
// matter are the ones a line reader got wrong: several values on one
// line, a value carrying a comma or a colon, and a note a person has
// typed extra lines into.
//
// It also holds the TRANSITION. A note written in the retired
// `zone: a, b` shape still has to resolve until `zone wash` has
// rewritten them all, and the day that stops working is the day every
// shared secret reads as missing from one of its two declarations.

// The globals `term boot` prepends, installed by hand. FIRST, before any
// import of ../host/**. See test/shim.ts.
