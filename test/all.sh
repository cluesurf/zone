#   bash test/all.sh                 from this package
#   pnpm zone:test                   from the monorepo base
#   pnpm zone:test --only note       one suite, while iterating
#   pnpm zone:test --list            name the suites and stop
#
# `--only` takes a substring and matches suite names, the same way
# `pnpm term:test --only` does. It exists because the alternative is
# what everybody actually does instead: a throwaway shell script that
# cd's into the package and runs one file, written again every time.
#
# Ordered cheapest first, so a broken build fails in seconds rather than
# after two minutes of shell harnesses.
#
#   tree     the language-level tests, run by the Term test runner
#   note     the secret note: written as `host` data, read by the compiler
#   seal     sealing and opening, including refusal on a tampered value
#   cache    the on-disk cache shape and its warm-read budget
#   sdk      the provider write path, against a fake SDK
#   help     the console's help surface, and drift between it and the dispatcher
#   fresh    cache freshness, and that a good cache never calls the provider
#   save     `zone save --name`: every value shape byte for byte, the cache
#            following the write, a bind edit reaching the next load
#   load     `zone load` end to end against a local cache
#   e2e      the whole pipeline against a fake provider, no keychain, no network
#
# Nothing here touches a real credential, a system keychain, or the network.
